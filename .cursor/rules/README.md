2. **Best Practices**: Recommended patterns for different aspects of the application
3. **Technical Standards**: Requirements for type safety, security, and performance
4. **Domain-Specific Guidelines**: Tenant association business logic implementation

## How Rules Work

Cursor uses these rules to provide better suggestions and code completions by understanding:

- The specific architecture of the application
- Coding standards and conventions
- Domain-specific requirements
- Common patterns used throughout the codebase

## Maintaining Rules

As the application evolves, these rules should be updated to reflect changes in:

- Architecture decisions
- Best practices
- New features or requirements
- Technology updates

## Usage

No special action is needed to use these rules. Cursor will automatically apply them when working with the codebase. However, developers should be familiar with these rules to understand Cursor's suggestions and ensure consistent code quality.
