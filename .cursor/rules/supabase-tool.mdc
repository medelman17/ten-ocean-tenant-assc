# Supabase Database Tool Usage

## Description
When making changes that affect the database or when debugging database-related issues, use the `mcp_supabase_query` tool to check the current state of the database.

## Restrictions

IMPORTANT! Only use the tool to read. NEVER WRITE!

## When to Use
1. When modifying database-related code
2. When debugging data issues
3. When verifying data transformations
4. When checking relationships between tables

## Best Practices
1. Always include relevant JOIN tables to get complete context
2. Use descriptive aliases for table names
3. Include ORDER BY clauses when sequence matters
4. Use WHERE clauses to limit results to relevant data
5. Include created_at/updated_at in results when debugging timing issues

## Security Notes
1. Never expose sensitive data in logs
2. Use parameterized queries when possible
3. Only query necessary columns
4. Remember this is read-only access
