# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement connection pooling and query optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up database connection pooling and optimize Prisma queries for improved performance.
# Details:
1. Configure Prisma connection pool settings in schema.prisma
2. Implement PgBouncer for connection pooling if needed
3. Use Prisma's `findMany` with `select` and `where` for optimized queries
4. Implement data loader pattern for N+1 query prevention
5. Use Prisma's `include` judiciously to avoid over-fetching
6. Implement query caching where appropriate
7. Use database indexes for frequently queried fields

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark query performance before and after optimization
2. Test connection pool under high load
3. Verify N+1 query prevention
4. Validate query cache effectiveness
