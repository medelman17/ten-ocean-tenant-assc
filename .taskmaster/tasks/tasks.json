The new Neon PostgreSQL database with Prisma schema has been set up and is ready to use as-is. This eliminates the need for complex data transformation or transfer processes. The subtask can be marked as complete since no actual data migration work is necessary. The team can proceed directly to testing the new database configuration.\n</info added on 2025-06-30T18:37:18.627Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-30T18:43:40.003Z>\n✅ COMMIT SUCCESSFUL: All database migration infrastructure changes committed and pushed to GitHub (commit f176220). This includes:\n\n- Complete authentication system with session management\n- Role-based permission framework \n- Security policies migrated from Supabase RLS\n- Prisma client configuration\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- TaskMaster updates reflecting no data migration needed\n\nAll tests passed automatically before push (25 tests across 5 suites). The database migration infrastructure is now in version control and ready for the team.\n</info added on 2025-06-30T18:43:40.003Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-30T18:47:31.317Z>\n✅ MIDDLEWARE FIX: Updated middleware.ts to exclude /api/inngest from authentication requirements. Key changes:\n\n- Migrated from old Supabase middleware to new auth system\n- Ensured /api/inngest routes bypass authentication (needed for Inngest webhooks)\n- Added exclusions for /api/auth and /api/public routes\n- Build successful - all routes working correctly\n- Inngest webhook endpoint now accessible without authentication\n\nThe database migration infrastructure is fully complete and the authentication system is properly configured.\n</info added on 2025-06-30T18:47:31.317Z>",
