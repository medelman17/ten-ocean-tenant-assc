# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement data migration scripts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and test scripts to migrate data from Supabase to Neon PostgreSQL while maintaining data integrity.
# Details:
1. Use Prisma's `findMany` and `create` methods for data transfer
2. Implement batching for large datasets to avoid memory issues
3. Use transactions to ensure data consistency
4. Preserve created_at and updated_at timestamps
5. Handle Supabase-specific data types (e.g., arrays, JSON)
6. Implement progress logging and error handling
7. Create a rollback mechanism in case of migration failure

# Test Strategy:
1. Perform dry-run migrations on a subset of data
2. Verify data integrity post-migration
3. Test rollback procedures
4. Validate handling of edge cases and special data types
